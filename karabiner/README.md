# Karabiner Elements

Custom shortcuts for MacOS:
- `symbol layer` -- a simple symbol layer mapping numbers to the left hand and `=_+-(){}[]` to the right hand; works only on QWERTY layout, because it remaps buttons and doesn't change a layout itself
- `extended layer` -- a custom extended layer w/ motion, layout change, program shortcuts. Uses layout similar to [here](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1438-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-linuxxkb-files-included/), but motions are bound to the left hand. Activated w/ `RightCommand` remapped to nothing on press.
- `spacebar -> left_alt (spacebar if pressed alone)` -- single `Space` press is `Space`, `Space` press-and-hold is `Alt`
- `caps_lock -> left_control` -- `CapsLock` to `LeftControl`
