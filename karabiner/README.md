# Karabiner Elements

Custom shortcuts for MacOS:
- `symbol layer on spacebar presssed+another key` -- a simple symbol layer mapping numbers to the left hand, `=_+-(){}[]` to the right hand, and mapping `Shift+<Digit>` to digits row; works only on QWERTY layout, because it remaps buttons and doesn't change a layout itself
- `extended layer` -- a custom extended layer w/ motion, layout change, program shortcuts. Uses a layout similar to [this one](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1438-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-linuxxkb-files-included/), but motion are bound to the left hand. Activated w/ `RightCommand` remapped to nothing on press.
- `caps_lock -> left_control` -- `CapsLock` to `LeftControl`
